# A few notes on the approach taken in the test
Excercises one and two are contained within the devtest project.

As there were no real expectation of input and output as in a real application, the main method runs a collection of unit tests against various trees.

The given interfaces in the document were treated as more or less unchangeable as a requirement and were preserved in a seperate namespace called com.nakhak.definition.

The third excercies was written in java as well.  It is in a seperate project called WordCounter.

The file that it tallies the word counts from can be specified at command line.  A file called loremIpsum.txt was included to play with.
